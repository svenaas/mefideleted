## MeFi Deleted

A simple Twitter bot written to tweet MetaFilter post deletion reasons at @mefideleted

This bot was written to run at Heroku and may be used as a simple example or starting point for other projects.

## Requirements for Deploying Something Like This

1) Twitter account

2) Twitter application

3) Heroku account

### Twitter Account

You'll probaby want a new Twitter account for your bot.

### Twitter Application

Log into Twitter using the account that the bot will use. Then go to https://dev.twitter.com/ and sign up for a new Twitter appication. 

**Note:** If your bot is going to post then you're going to need to give your application write access to the Twitter account, and as of this writing (2014) Twitter won't let you do this unless your Twitter account has a mobile phone number associated with it. Twitter furthermore won't let you associate a mobile phone number that's already associated with another Twitter account. Catch-22! Fortunately, you can request write access via http://support.twitter.com/ — do this from your bot's Twitter account, but tell them who you really are and let them know you're not to anything underhanded.

### Heroku Account

In my use this application does not require more than a free tier of service from Heroku or associated service providers, but your use may differ. 

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
